# About - General
We are the Envoys of Dissonance, a Free Company from Gilgamesh in the Aether Datacenter. We are allied with the Maelstrom, and our tag is <<ENVOY>>. Founded on 7/22/2020, we 

Most of us are on almost every evening, and as such we do not have a regular "meeting" time. Our Company Leader, Billy (A.K.A. Kelvius Argent), has been trying to get a group together for raiding for several months now.

At this time, we are actively recruiting for members to join us as we journey into Endwalker territory. However, we are open to all levels of players, from beginners to experts. Our focuses are Leveling, Casual, Dungeons, Trials, and Raids.

## Housing
We have a Free Company house located at Plot 55, 10th Ward, Mist, named Evening Overlook. 
### Greeting
> A place of many things: of light and dark, of loud and quiet, of soldiers and sorcerers

# Our Rules
* Treat others as you want to be treated;
* We do not condone racism, sexism or homophobia.
* Please no spoliers unless agreed upon by all involved.
* Please respect people's triggers - they are not a joke, they are there for a reason.
