      <description>Rank Information Our ranks go as such:
 Dragon - The Leader of the Free Company, and highest-ranking officer Soldier - Second-rank members; These members have shown to be incredibly helpful in some way, be it crafting, gathering, or instructing new players. Sorcerer - Third-rank members; A group primarily made of some of the oldest and most trusted members of the Company Envoy - Currently the lowest rank; nothing special about these members, except that they make up the bulk of our Company!</description>

      <description>Hello, Envoys! This is Nexan, the maintainer of our current Music Bot, the Ironworks Orchestrionâ„¢. It can be utilized by using the commands found here. Please note, not everyone will have access to all the commands, as most members of the server are only able to use the basic commands. Should we decide that more commands are needed for regular members, we can expand that.
Friendly reminder, if you use the new ðŸŽµ Ironworks Orchestrion ðŸŽµ, please remember to disconnect it from the channel after use, as it&amp;rsquo;s not currently set up to auto-disconnect.</description>
